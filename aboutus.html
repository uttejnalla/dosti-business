                    <p>The idea for Dosti Business came from a conversation between me and my friend.<br> We didn't know where this idea would take us, but we decided to start.<br> Just like in business, taking risks and starting is essential.<br> Although obstacles may arise, we should keep moving forward,<br> similar to how friendship begins and continues without going back or leaving.<br> Our website, Dosti Business, reflects this philosophy of starting strong and persevering,<br> drawing inspiration from the enduring nature of friendship.</p>
